Battleship project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship)

Javascript, HTML, CSS, Webpack, Jest. Developed using Test Driven Development. Attack the CPU board and try to sink their ships before they sink yours.
CPU randomly chooses until it finds a ship, then tries to hunt down the remaining tiles until the ship is sunk.

Further development:

- drag and drop ship placement
- custom ship images
- CSS animations for attacks, hits, misses, ship sunk
- refactor cpuSmartAttack
